# BMI Calculator App

A simple and responsive **Body Mass Index (BMI)** calculator built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This app allows users to calculate their BMI based on their height and weight, using either the Metric or Imperial system. The result is displayed with the BMI value and the corresponding weight category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

## Demo

You can check out the live demo [here](https://bmi-calculator-app-uowi.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Calculate BMI using both **Metric** (cm, kg) and **Imperial** (inches, lbs) units.
- Clean and responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Dynamic feedback on the BMI result with weight category classification.
- Easy-to-use input fields and a radio button group for unit selection.
- Client-side validation for input fields (height and weight).

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast, server-side rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code quality and readability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
